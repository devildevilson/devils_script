Script system similar to Paradox games scripts (CK3, EU4). While working on this I have completely forgot how Paradox lang is looks like. Thus the comma separator was born

# TODO:
1. different functions depending on scope (+) (tests?)
2. assert (?)
3. better callable for iterators (subblock in common.h ?)
4. another file for benchmark
5. container::make_table does not work
