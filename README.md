# devils_script
Script system similar to Paradox games scripts (CK3, EU4)

The only dependency is STL + Catch2 for tests

Look tests for examples

Do I need to put here more text?

# TODO:
1. different functions depending on scope
2. assert (?)
3. better callable for iterators (subblock in common.h ?)
4. another file for benchmark
